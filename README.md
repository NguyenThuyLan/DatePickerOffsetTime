# DatePicker with Offset time

**DatePicker with Offset time** is a property editor that shows the time to editors relative to their respective time zone rather than the server time like what the default Umbraco date time picker does.

No configuration is required for the package. Once installed, simply log into the BackOffice, and you will find a new property editor **DatePicker with Offset time**.
